## Demo
Check out a simple web demo I created and deployed with Heroku here: https://dehao-iris-clf.herokuapp.com/. This web app displays model prediction results based on user-input parameters. 

## Overview
This is a simple classification task performed on the Iris dataset - one of the best known dataset in the world of data science.

## Motivation
I am definitely not a flower expert, but with the help of a dataset with 150 iris instances with their petal/sepal measurements, can I be one? Also which of the petal/sepal measurements are more useful features to look at?
