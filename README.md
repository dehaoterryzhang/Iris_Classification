## Overview
This is a simple classification task performed on the Iris dataset - one of the best known dataset in the world of data science.

## Motivation
I am definitely not a flower expert, but with the help of a dataset with 150 iris instances with their petal/sepal measurements, can I be one? Also which of the petal/sepal measurements are more useful to look at?

## Procedures
  * Import Libraries and Load Dataset
